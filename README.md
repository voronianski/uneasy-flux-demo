# Practical Flux for uneasy APIs

> Flux patterns for unexpected scenarios like handling API errors or dealing with pending requests.

## Disclaimer

After publication of [Flux Comparison](https://github.com/voronianski/flux-comparison) repo I've received several [questions](http://pixelhunter.me/post/110248593059/flux-solutions-compared-by-example#comment-1845704464) regarding pending/error-handling of API requests. This demo aims to show the practical approaches that worked for me and some of my recent applications.

## What's inside?

- Future-proof with [babel]()'s ES6 and [cssnext]()
- Flux powered by [Flummox]()
- Components powered by [React]()
- UI powered by [Basscss]()
- Multi-page app boilerplate
- Isomorphism for free
- **Awkward API that will puzzle us with timeouts and errors**

## Principles
